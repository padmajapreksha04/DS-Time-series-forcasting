# Overview
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, daily seasonality. Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots usually appear in 
pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.

# Objective
To implement a Time Series Forecasting model in Python, by using the FBProphet module.To Develop a time-unit-agnostic pipeline using FBProphet to forecast sunspot values for specified future periods, tuning growth, seasonality, and trend parameters, and evaluating models with MAE, MAPE, and RÂ² metrics.

# Dataset
Testing the forecasting model in three 3 distinct datasets. On Daily, Monthly Mean, and Yearly Mean sunspots.

# Tools and Technologies
Python (for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization)

Libraries

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime, Prophet, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook (for interactive data analysis and documentation)
